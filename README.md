# PLPA COURSE WORK: DOCUMENTS WITH GRAPHICS AND TEXT
"A portable and scalable format for graphics with text is needed that can be stored and sent via the Internet. The format should support drawing lines, rectangles, circles and text."

This project is developed in Scala and Java. The graphics painter is implemented in Scala. The GUI is implemented in Java. The graphics are in the two-dimensional plane. A BoundingBox((x1 y1) (x2 y2)) method is needed as the first input. This will define the drawing area for the graphics painter.

The following methods can be written in the text field:
* BoundingBox((x1 y1) (x2 y2))
* Line((x1 y1) (x2 y2))
* Rectangle((x1 y1) (x2 y2))
* Circle((x1 y1) r)
* TextAt((x1 y1) t)
* Draw(c g1 g2 ... gN)
* Fill(c g)

To be continued...
